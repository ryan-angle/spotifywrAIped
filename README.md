Spotify WrAIpped is a Web Application which allows users to login using their Spotify credentials, and have an opportunity to guess which of their favorite artists was used as a prompt for an AI-generated lyric.
As a user, you are first prompted to login through Spotify. After doing so, you are redirected back to SpotifyWrAIpped, where you are then thrown into a game.
There are 10 rounds, and for each round the user is presented with an AI-generated lyric based on one of their top 20 artists of the past 6 months.
You are given four of these 20 artists as answer choices, and their score increases by one point for each question answered correctly.
The goal of the game is simply to achieve your personal highest score!
